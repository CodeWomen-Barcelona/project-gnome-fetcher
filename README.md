## Code for the project Gnome Fetcher

This is a private repo because we want our students to write the code themselves as much as possible. Only the coaches have access to private repos in this GitHub organisation.

The Gnome Fetcher project has three levels of difficulty: 
* starters (challenge: build the page, add specific styling elements, make responsive, only HTML and CSS)
* more advanced (challenge: build a React app, get necessary data from the API and show this in gnome cards on the screen)
* graduates (challenge: add filter and search functionality, error handling, responsiveness)

This repo provides the code for the React app, including filter. Styling is basic.

Suggestions are always welcome (henriette@migracode.org).
